# Who's That Witch? - Session Summary
## Date: October 19, 2025 - 10:59

## Current State

**GAME COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED!** All features fully implemented and working on both local server and GitHub Pages. Game is production-ready with no known bugs.

## Recent Work Completed (This Session)

### 1. GitHub Pages Deployment Fix ✅
**Problem:** Game worked perfectly on local server, but on GitHub Pages deployment, images in `assets/usedInGame/other/` and `assets/usedInGame/specialTiles/` were returning 404 errors. Witch images loaded fine, but back images, button images, and special tile images failed.

**Investigation:**
- Verified all files exist in correct locations locally
- Confirmed files are committed and pushed to GitHub
- Checked that local HEAD matches remote origin/main
- Discovered no `.nojekyll` file in repository

**Root Cause:** GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default to process sites. Jekyll's processing was interfering with nested asset directory paths, causing 404 errors for some subdirectories.

**Solution:** Added `.nojekyll` file to repository root
- Created empty `.nojekyll` file
- Tells GitHub Pages to bypass Jekyll processing
- Serves files directly without transformation
- Common fix for GitHub Pages with nested asset structures

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `.nojekyll` (empty file in root)
- Commit: "Add .nojekyll file to fix GitHub Pages asset paths"
- Pushed to GitHub main branch

**Result:** All images now load correctly on GitHub Pages deployment at https://johnpendergrass.github.io/whosThatWitch/

### 2. CSS Enhancements - Witch List Formatting ✅

**Added HARD Difficulty Padding Control:**
Previously, EASY and MEDIUM difficulties had explicit CSS rules for vertical positioning of the witch list, but HARD just inherited default padding. Added explicit control for consistency.

**CSS Added** (style.css:327-330):
```css
/* HARD difficulty - vertically centered (13 characters total) */
#status-box.hardTiles #character-list {
  padding-top: 25px; /* Adjust this value to center */
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Now all three difficulties have explicit, documented padding control
- Makes it easier to adjust vertical positioning
- Maintains consistent code pattern across difficulties
- User adjusted from initial 10px to 25px for better centering

**Other CSS Adjustments:**
- Line spacing between witch names: Changed from `margin-bottom: 8px` to `7px` (user preference)
- Clicks display font: Changed from `"Barrio", cursive` to `"Arial", sans-serif` to match rest of scoring area

### 3. Image Preloading - First Play Flash Fix ✅

**Problem:** When clicking a difficulty button for the first time after page load, witch tile images briefly flashed before the face-down (back) images loaded and covered them. This happened on all difficulty levels but only on first play (not after, due to browser caching).

**Why It Happened:**
- All tile images (face-up witches, face-down backs, halftone overlays) loaded simultaneously when difficulty button clicked
- Images relied on z-index layering: face-up (z:1), halftone (z:2), face-down (z:3)
- If face-down images took split second to download, face-up images were briefly visible
- After first play, back images were cached, so no flash

**Solution: Preload Back Images**
Created `preloadBackImages()` function that loads all three back images at game startup (before player clicks any difficulty).

**Implementation:**

**New Function** (js/whosThatWitch.js:212-229):
```javascript
function preloadBackImages() {
  const backImages = [
    'assets/usedInGame/other/_back_witchOnBroom_99.png',   // Hard
    'assets/usedInGame/other/_back_witchOnBroom_124.png',  // Medium
    'assets/usedInGame/other/_back_witchOnBroom_166.png'   // Easy
  ];

  backImages.forEach(src => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = src;
  });

  console.log('Preloaded back images for all difficulty levels');
}
```

**Function Call** (js/whosThatWitch.js:173-174):
```javascript
// Preload back images to prevent flash on first play
preloadBackImages();
```

**Added to initGame() sequence:**
1. Load game configuration
2. Load tile data and image list
3. Build grouped witches
4. **Preload back images** ← NEW
5. Setup buttons
6. Load best scores
7. Setup event listeners
8. Draw initial idle state

**Result:** Back images are cached before player starts, eliminating flash on first play.

### 4. Font Consistency - Scoring Area ✅

**Change:** Updated clicks display font to match rest of scoring area

**Before:**
```css
#current-clicks {
  font-family: "Barrio", cursive;
  font-size: 18px;
```

**After:**
```css
#current-clicks {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
```

**Why:** Creates visual consistency across entire scoring area (clicks, best scores, control labels, buttons all use Arial)

**Font sizes kept different for hierarchy:**
- Clicks display: 18px (largest, most important)
- Best scores: 12px
- Control labels: 12px
- Control buttons: 11px

## Technical Implementation Notes

### GitHub Pages Configuration
- Repository: https://github.com/johnpendergrass/whosThatWitch.git
- Deployment URL: https://johnpendergrass.github.io/whosThatWitch/
- Branch: main
- `.nojekyll` file prevents Jekyll processing
- All assets served directly without transformation

### Image Preloading Strategy
- Only back images preloaded (3 files total)
- Witch images NOT preloaded (106+ files would slow initial load)
- Just-in-time loading for witch images works well since they're covered
- Browser cache handles subsequent plays efficiently

### CSS Positioning Strategy
All three difficulty levels now use consistent pattern:

**EASY (9 tiles, 6 witches):**
```css
#status-box.easyTiles #character-list {
  padding-top: 110px;
}
```

**MEDIUM (16 tiles, 9 witches):**
```css
#status-box.mediumTiles #character-list {
  padding-top: 65px;
}
```

**HARD (25 tiles, 13 witches):**
```css
#status-box.hardTiles #character-list {
  padding-top: 25px;
}
```
