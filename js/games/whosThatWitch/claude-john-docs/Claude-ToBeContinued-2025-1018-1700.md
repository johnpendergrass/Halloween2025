## Recent Work Completed (This Session)

### 1. Black Cat Hints Element
- âœ… Added black cat image to top-right corner (`assets/usedInGame/other/_blackCat_480x346.png`)
- âœ… Positioned and sized: 350Ã—200px, rotated -10 degrees
- âœ… Z-index: 60 (above status-box, below nothing)
- âœ… Location: top: -20px, right: 75px

**HTML:** `<div id="hints-cat">` with `<img id="cat-image">`
**CSS:** `#hints-cat` and `#cat-image` styles

### 2. Cat Hover Tooltip Instructions
- âœ… Added hover tooltip that appears below cat after 1-second delay
- âœ… Tooltip content includes:
  - "Select a level: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD"
  - "SPECIAL TILES:" section describing Free look!, Redo!, Swap!
  - "Also" section about clues toggle
  - "Also" section about scoring toggle
- âœ… Styling: semi-transparent dark purple background, purple border, light gray text
- âœ… Yellow highlights for section headers and tile names
- âœ… 1 second hover delay with fade-in animation
- âœ… Width: 300px, positioned centered below cat

**HTML:** `<div class="cat-description">` inside hints-cat
**CSS:** `.cat-description`, hover animation with `@keyframes fadeIn`

### 3. Difficulty-Specific Character List Centering
- âœ… Implemented CSS classes applied dynamically based on difficulty
- âœ… JavaScript sets `#status-box` className to difficultyId (easyTiles, mediumTiles, hardTiles)
- âœ… CSS rules for vertical centering:
  - EASY: padding-top: 110px (6 characters - more centered)
  - MEDIUM: padding-top: 65px (9 characters - somewhat centered)
  - HARD: padding-top: 20px (13 characters - default, fills list)

**JavaScript:** `drawGrid()` function sets `statusBox.className = difficultyId`
**CSS:** `#status-box.easyTiles #character-list`, etc.

### 4. Fixed Character Tooltip Z-Index Stacking Issue
- âœ… Problem: Character description tooltips showed scoring area text through them
- âœ… Root cause: Stacking context - tooltips trapped inside #status-box (z-index: 50)
- âœ… Solution: Made #status-box transparent with pointer-events: none
  - `background: transparent` (was black)
  - `border: none` (was 2px solid black)
  - `pointer-events: none` (allows clicks to pass through)
  - `#character-list` has `pointer-events: auto` (re-enables character name clicks)
- âœ… Lowered #scoring-area z-index from 100 to 40
- âœ… Result: Tooltips (z-index: 1000 within status-box) now appear above scoring area

**Z-Index Stack:**
- 60: Cat
- 50: Status-box (transparent, click-through)
  - 1000: Character tooltips (now visible above scoring)
- 40: Scoring area

### 5. Scoring Toggle Improvements
- âœ… Scoring ON/OFF button now hides/shows best scores display
- âœ… Modified `updateClickDisplay()` to toggle `#best-scores-display` visibility
- âœ… When OFF: both clicks counter AND best scores row are hidden
- âœ… When ON: both are visible (display: flex for scores row)

**JavaScript:** `updateClickDisplay()` function (lines 285-305)

### 6. UI Text and Tooltip Refinements
- âœ… Fixed cat tooltip left-justification (removed &nbsp; spacing)
- âœ… Changed CSS `white-space: pre-wrap` to `white-space: normal`
- âœ… Cleaned up HTML formatting for proper line breaks
- âœ… Updated tooltip descriptions for clarity
- âœ… Line-height adjusted to 1.5 for readability

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Locations
- **HTML:** `index.html` (lines 54-82 for cat element)
- **CSS:** `style.css` (lines 382-435 for cat/tooltip styles)
- **JavaScript:** `whosThatWitch.js` (lines 911-915 for difficulty classes, 285-305 for scoring toggle)

### CSS Classes Added/Modified
- `#hints-cat` - Container for cat image and tooltip
- `#cat-image` - Cat image styling with rotation
- `.cat-description` - Tooltip styling (reused class name)
- `@keyframes fadeIn` - 1-second delay fade-in animation
- `#status-box.easyTiles`, `.mediumTiles`, `.hardTiles` - Difficulty-specific centering

### Key CSS Properties
- `pointer-events: none` on #status-box - Critical for click-through
- `pointer-events: auto` on #character-list - Re-enables clicks
- `animation-delay: 1s` - 1-second hover delay for cat tooltip
- `transform: rotate(-10deg)` - Cat image rotation

## Current File Structure

### HTML (index.html)
- Game title and subtitle
- Scoring area (bottom-right): clicks, best scores, buttons, controls
- Board container (502Ã—502)
- Status box with character list (transparent background)
- Hints cat with hover tooltip (top-right)

### CSS (style.css)
- **Lines 63-143:** Scoring area, buttons, controls, bomb animations
- **Lines 291-326:** Status box and difficulty-specific centering
- **Lines 359-380:** Character tooltips
- **Lines 382-435:** Cat and cat tooltip styles

### JavaScript (whosThatWitch.js)
- **Lines 11-26:** Global variables (game state, scoring, clues)
- **Lines 285-305:** Scoring and display functions
- **Lines 337-355:** Toggle functions (scoring, clues, reset)
- **Lines 911-915:** Difficulty class assignment in drawGrid()

## Known Issues / Edge Cases

1. âœ… All features working as expected
2. âœ… Character tooltips now properly overlay scoring area
3. âœ… Buttons remain clickable despite transparent status-box
4. âœ… Cat tooltip delays and fades in correctly
5. âœ… Difficulty-specific centering works for all three levels

## Next Steps (Planned)

### Immediate: Victory Celebration Animation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Create celebration effect when player completes all witches**
  - Design: What type of celebration? (confetti, animation, sound, message overlay?)
  - Trigger: In `checkGameCompletion()` function when all witches matched AND named
  - Duration: How long should celebration last?
  - Elements: Visual effects, congratulatory message, final score display
  - Options: CSS animation, canvas effects, or simple overlay with styled message

### Design Questions to Answer:
- Should celebration auto-dismiss or require user click?
- Show final stats (clicks, time, best score beaten)?
- Replay button or just restart with difficulty selection?
- Confetti/particle effects or simpler animation?
- Sound effects (if so, need to add audio files)?

### Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)
- ðŸ”² Sound effects for matches, special tiles, completion
- ðŸ”² Timer mode (speed challenge)
- ðŸ”² Achievement system
- ðŸ”² Mobile responsive layout
- ðŸ”² Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- ðŸ”² Additional special tiles or power-ups
- ðŸ”² Difficulty progression/unlock system

## Development Notes

### Game Flow Summary
1. Player selects difficulty (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD)
2. Grid generates with witch pairs and special tiles
3. Player clicks tiles to reveal and match witches
4. Special tiles provide bonuses or penalties
5. Player identifies witch by clicking name in character list
6. Scoring tracks clicks (lower is better)
7. Best scores saved to localStorage per difficulty
8. **[NEXT]** Celebration when all witches complete

### Code Quality
- Well-documented functions with JSDoc comments
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase)
- Modular special tile handlers
- localStorage for score persistence
- CSS classes for state management
- Pointer-events for click-through overlays
- Z-index layering properly managed

### Performance Considerations
- Transparent overlays require careful z-index management
- Pointer-events: none prevents performance issues with large overlay elements
- Animation delays use CSS (hardware accelerated)
- Tooltip positioning uses transform for better performance
